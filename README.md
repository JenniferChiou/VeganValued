# VeganValued
## A website created for the TecHacks 2.0 Hackathon!

This project was created by Jennifer Chiou, Adrianna Grant, and Angelina Wu using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We spent a lot of time optimizing both its visual pleasure and its efficient functionality, so we hope you enjoy!

## Instructions for Use:
For those cloning our repository:
> Please download our "images" folder, HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to your device. Make sure that all files are named correctly!
> After that, simply click on the HTML file and enjoy!
> NOTE: On the Ethnic Grocers tab on the website, you will notice that the Google Maps portion is watermarked with "For Development Purposes Only." This is because our API key is not linked to a professional google account, but aside from the watermark, everything on the map is functional!
